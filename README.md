A bank has an account list and a customer list. From a customer we know his Identification Number, Name, Last Name, Address and Phone, Cell Phone. We can make a review of all accounts from a bank. On each account we can: o Enter Money o Withdraw Money o Check balance o Change client o Get Monthly report Monthly report consider: balance = balance + account_interest - commission  All accounts has a 1.1$ of commission that could be modified. Exist three types of accounts: Current Account(CC), Housing Account(HA) and Investment Fund(FI). Interest value of CC is 0.11%, for HA is 0.22% and for IF is 0.33%. You cannot get more money from CC than there is, from IF you can get up to 600$ of red numbers (if the account is exceeded it is blocked) and HA cannot withdraw money. Monthly report of HA does not pay bank commission. A bank has points account, each time 10$ is entered, one account point is added. You can see how many points the account has.
